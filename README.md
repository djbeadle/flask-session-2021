Flask-Session-2021
==================

`Flask-Session-2021` is an extension for the Python Flask framework that adds support for server-side session to your application.

You should also check out these other solutions:
- [Flask-login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login) by Max Countryman

  Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask. It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your users' sessions over extended periods of time.

- [Flask's built-in client-side session](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/master/quickstart/#sessions)

  Note that secrets should never be stored stored in the client-side session. [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-secure-is-the-flask-user-session) has a good blog post describing the issue.

Notes on this Fork
==================

`Flask-Session-2021` is a fork of the [Flask-Session](https://github.com/fengsp/flask-session) package by [fengsp](https://github.com/fengsp/). The goal is to be a drop in replacement for the original package
